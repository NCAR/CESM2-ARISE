## Under Development
Note that this repo is still under early development; we'll remove this note once some initial testing is complete.


# CESM2-ARISE
This repo contains example notebooks and the Intake-ESM catalog for using data from the CESM2 ARISE simulations hosted on AWS's OpenData program.

For additional information on the ARISE-SAI project itself, please see:
https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/projects/community-projects/ARISE-SAI/

## Data description
At the moment, we have the ARISE-SAI-1.5 data available, with additional datasets being added soon.  This set has 10 ensemble members.



## How to use this data
This data can be used from anywhere, including via AWS cloud instances, which offer the fastest access speeds since they're co-located with the data itself.  Instructions for launching JupyterHub on AWS will be coming shortly.  The example notebooks, also coming soon, show how to use this data from Jupyter / Python, and should work on any platform with a compatible conda environment.  If you need to create one, we'll have both a minimalist environment YAML file, and a link to the full (and recommended) EASE environment YAML added here shortly.
