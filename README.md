# CESM2-ARISE

Solar climate intervention using stratospheric aerosol injection is a proposed method of reducing global mean temperatures in order to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. Assessing Responses and Impacts of Solar climate intervention on the Earth system with Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (ARISE-SAI-1.5) is a set of simulations carried out with the Community Earth System Model, version 2 with the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model, version 6 (CESM2(WACCM6)) that aims at simulating a plausible deployment of solar climate intervention of stratospheric aerosol injection to enable community assessment of responses of the Earth system. In this set of simulations stratospheric aerosol injection is introduced at ~ 21 km in simulated year 2035. The simulations utilize the middle-of-the-road SSP2-4.5 emission scenario, and keep global mean surface air temperature near 1.5°C above the pre-industrial value. Sulfur dioxide injections in the ARISE-SAI-1.5 simulations are placed at four injection locations (15°S, 15°N, 30°S, 30°N) into one grid box at 180° longitude, and midpoint altitude of 21.6 km. The injection amount at each latitude is specified annually by a “controller” algorithm.

There are 10 ensemble members of “reference” or SSP2-4.5 simulations (without climate intervention) with CESM2(WACCM6) that accompany the ARISE-SAI-1.5 simulations.
